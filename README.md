# Welcome to my README.md file.

Hello, let me introduce myself.

My Name is Aytac, I am 28 years old and was born on december 21, 1994 in Hamburg.

In August 2015 I startet a training as a merchant for office management in the marketing department at a privat highschool.

After my training, I worked as an employee for six months. After the six months I was looking for a new challenge to get new experience.

From July 2018 to August 2023 I worked as a taxi driver in cooperation with the [Hansa-Taxi](https://www.taxi211211.de/de/) company in Hamburg.

Now I am looking for a job that is important for the future and also secure for the future, so i decided to take part at the bootcamp NeueFische.

I donÂ´t have much experience in web development, but I did take an online course on udemy before I applied to NeueFische.

Topics in the online course:
- HTML
- CSS
- some JS
